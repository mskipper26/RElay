# About RE:lay

RE:lay is a social media platform designed around the idea of letter chains, a form of viral communication which was common in the early internet. The goal of enforcing the strict limitations on the manner in which users can communicate is to promote intentional connectivity and to prevent the toxic, reactionary interactions common in modern social media. This allows for virality and spread of ideas while keeping the user's network growth controlled and intentioned.

## How to connect:

To grow your network, you have three options. 

1. **Referral**: Navigating to the **'Identity'** tab will direct you to your profile page, where you can click **'Generate Invite Code'** to generate a unique, single-use code that can be shared with a new user to allow them to create an account. Upon creating an account, a connection will automatically be created between the two users, which cannot be removed.
2. **Invite Code**: Following the same process as **Referral**, you can share an invite code with a preexisting user, allowing them to redeem it for a new connection, which is able to be removed. To redeem an invite code, navigate to the **'Network'** tab and enter the code into the field labeled **'Enter Invite Code'** and click **'Connect'**.
3. **Letter Chain**: When you receive a letter in your inbox that was forwarded from a user in your network, if the user who sent/forwarded the letter to the user you received the letter from is not already in your network, you will have the option to add them to your network using the **'Connect with [User]'** button at the bottom of the letter. This connection cannot be removed.

## Composing a Letter:

To compose a letter, click the **'New Letter'** button at the top of the mailbox. This will direct you to the **'Compose Letter'** menu. Here, you must at least give the letter a subject and a body. You can also attach up to 3 images from your image library to the letter using the **'+ Add Image'** button.

Once you have given the letter a subject and a body, you can click the toggle below the letter to choose between saving a draft or sending. If you choose to save a draft, click the blue **'Save Draft'** button. You can see all of your drafts in the **'Drafts'** tab of the mailbox. If you choose to send, select 1-3 users from your network to send the letter to in the **'Select Recipients'** box. After selecting the recipients, click the blue **'Send Correspondence'** button. You can see all of the letters you've sent and any annotations made by other users in the **'Sent'** tab of the mailbox.

## Receiving a Letter:

When you receive a letter, it will appear in the **'Inbox'** tab of the mailbox. Letters will stay in your inbox until they are burned or forwarded. Upon opening the letter, you will have a few options.

- **Burn**: Burn the letter, removing it from you inbox and removing your access to your copy (the letter may come back to you if multiple users in your network forward it to you). Before burning you will have the option to leave an annotation which can be viewed by all users with access to that particular letter. 
- **Forward**: Forward the letter to another user in your network. Clicking the **'Forward'** button below the letter will direct you to a menu where you can select up to 3 users to forward the letter to and leave an optional annotation. When you are ready to forward the letter, click the **'Confirm Forward'** button.
    - **Archive**: After confirming, you will be prompted to archive the letter, giving you permanent access to the letter and any annotations made by other users with access to that particular letter. You can retain up to 10 letters in your archive at a time.

## Live Wire:

Clicking the **'Live Wire'** button at the bottom of the page will bring up a live chat feed where all users globally can chat with each other in real-time.
